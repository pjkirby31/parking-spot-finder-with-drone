GRAB IMAGES PARKING LOTS. 
OBJECT CLASSIFICATION ---> Cars, empty parking spots.

1. To try and find a model.
2. Add it to the code.

SELF FLYING DRONE PART OF THIS.

- HACK WAY OF RECORDING COMMANDS AND USING THEM TO FLY IT.


BEING ABLE TO DETECT WHERE THE PARKING SPOT LOCATION 
- Fly a set path and then label each parking lot 
- Use Markers to determine location and also fly.

Roadmap:
1. Find and buy a drone (we need one regardless of whether we do AirSim)
2. Install AirSim and everything we need for it
3. Test out using an enviroment and try training the drone to do something very simple to make sure it works
4. If test goes well, then create a basic enviroment of Arcadia for the drone to fly
    4a. I think there is a way to include the Yolo model into AirSim too
5. Put it all together
